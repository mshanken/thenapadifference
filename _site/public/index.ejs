		<h2 class="text-primary mx-lg-25">NAPA VALLEY DIFFERENCE</h2>

		<p class="mx-lg-25">For years, Napa Valley wines, including opulent Cabernets and rich Chardonnays, have been synonymous with special occasions. Today, Napa winemakers are increasingly producing wines at prices that may enable wine lovers to enjoy a bottle from Napa to celebrate the little moments in life. There’s no longer a need to wait for a milestone birthday or major event. Let any small victory—a win at work, the chance to reconnect with friends, or even just the arrival of cocktail hour—serve as the perfect excuse to open a bottle of Napa wine and explore the iconic region.</p>

		<p class="mx-lg-25">Just 30 miles long and a few miles wide, Napa Valley is set in a rare Mediterranean-like climate. It is home to a diverse range of microclimates and more than 100 soil variations that range from deep and fertile to sparse and rocky. Fine wine grapes thrive here in one of California’s oldest appellations.</p>

		<p class="mx-lg-25">Take, for example, wines from two of the Valley’s most renowned wineries: William Hill Estate and Louis M. Martini. Recognizing Napa’s incredible grape growing potential, visionary vineyard developer William Hill first set roots in 1976 at the foot of the ancient Vaca Mountains on the gentle rolling hills of Napa’s Silverado Bench. Today, the William Hill Estate’s portfolio of wines are sourced from grapes grown across Napa Valley, drawing character from the warm breezes of St. Helena and the cool, foggy vineyards of Carneros. The 2015 William Hill Estate Napa Valley Chardonnay is smooth and luxurious with a textured palate and full mouthfeel. Layered notes of tropical fruits, lemon and apple blend seamlessly with hints of baking spice, caramel and toasted oak. This wine’s lingering finish offers a complete and rich expression of the region.</p>

		<p class="mx-lg-25">Farther along Highway 29 in the heart of Napa Valley, the historic Louis M. Martini Winery continues its 85-year legacy based on the simple premise that the best grapes make the best wine. This winery is internationally acclaimed for iconic, Cabernet-based wines, such as the 2015 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. This dark burgundy Cabernet features deep layers of blackberry, blueberry, and black currant, all framed by sweet herbs, licorice, and toasted cedar. Rich and full-bodied, this superbly balanced wine has an expansive mid-palate and an exceptionally long finish. Uncork this classic, Napa Cabernet for an everyday celebration.</p>
